# Science-Fair
This is the Repository for all my 2019 Science Fair Project
My problem statement is:
Do certain words used by users on Twitter make them more likely to commit a mass shooting?
I did this by finding the most common words found in the manifestos of Elliot Rodger, the El Paso shooter, Dylann Roof, Jim David Adkisson, and Seung-Hui Cho by using Python. I then use that data to find potential killers based on the words used in their tweets.

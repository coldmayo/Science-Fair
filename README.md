This is the Repository for all my 2019 Science Fair Project
My problem statement is:
Do certain phrases used by people on Twitter make them more likely to commit a mass shooting?
I did this by using the package Textblob to classify whether or not certain tweets are similar to mass shooters manefestoes. In my training set I have phrases used by the mass shooters as Class_B and the tweets used by non shooters as Class_A.
